# Open Management Portal - Frontend

> The user-facing components of the Open Management Portal.

## Configuration

The following environment variables are available:

| Name | Example Value | Required |
|------|---------------|----------|
| BASE_URL | https://[my-omp-domain].com/ | True |
| BACKEND_URL | https://[my-api-domain].com/ | True |
| AUTH_CLIENT_ID | open-management-portal | True |
| AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT | https://[my-keycloak-domain].com/auth/realms/omp/protocol/openid-connect/auth | True |
| USERINFO_ENDPOINT | https://[my-keycloak-domain].com/auth/realms/omp/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo | True |
| TOKEN_ENDPOINT | https://[my-keycloak-domain].com/auth/realms/omp/protocol/openid-connect/token | True |

* These examples are based off of a realm named `omp` and a client named `open-management-portal` in Keycloak. For more information about how your Keycloak client is configured and the appropriate URLs to use, navigate to `[my-keycloak-domain]/auth/realms/[my-realm]/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

## Deployment

This project includes an `openshift-applier` inventory. To use it, make sure that you are logged in to the cluster and that you customize the variables in `.applier/inventory/group_vars/all.yml` - namely make sure that `deploy_vars` uses the correct endpoints. Once these are configured, you can deploy the project with:

```bash
$ cd .applier/

$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --roles-path=roles --force

$ ansible-playbook apply.yml -i inventory/
```

## Components

This project was built using Nuxt.js - a framework surrounding Vue. For more information, visit [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

UI elements are from [Patternfly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/).

The server-side components are written in TypeScript.

## Build Setup

The linter (ESLint) and style checker (Prettier) are currently enabled and **very strict**. New code must conform to style guidelines before a build will succeed. Editors such as VSCode should help with this. This is to ensure continued quality of the codebase.

## Testing

This project uses Jest for unit and snapshot testing. Snapshot testing is for the detection of unintended UI changes; however, if you _intentionally_ change a UI element, the snapshot test for that element will _fail_. Make sure to always update snapshots before committing if this is the case.

## Useful Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ yarn dev

# run unit & snapshot tests
$ yarn test

# update snapshot tests (if you've changed a UI element intentionally and have verified yourself that it renders correctly)
$ yarn test --updateSnapshot

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
